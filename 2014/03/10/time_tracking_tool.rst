Time tracking tool
==================

Another working methodology post, in order to remind me of which tool I used.
In order to keep track of tasks and time spent when in the commandline (where I
am most of the time) `TimeBook
<https://bitbucket.org/trevor/timebook/wiki/Home>`_ is a great tool. It allows
you do::

    t in "task i am working on"
    <do some work>
    t out

Then there will be an entry in your `timesheet` with today's date and the time
spent working on the task.
