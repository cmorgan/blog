Hal R. Varian
=============

In my quest to learn more about the big ideas in econometrics and finance I
happened upon Hal R. Varian. Hal is both a professor at UC Berkley and also
Chief Economist at Google, a couple of impressive positions held simultaneously
positions held simultaneously.

There is a trove of Hal's essays and papers available `here
<http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/people/hal/papers.html`_, I
particularly enjoyed his `comment on big data in economics
<http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2013/BeyondBigDataPaperFINAL.pdf>`_
which essentially espouses economists to not only analyse the electronic data
that pretty much any firm is amassing but also to perform experiments within
the bounds of the collection system, giving rise to similar advances has have
been gained in similar methods applied to e-marketing (see `Patrick McKenzie's
essays <http://www.kalzumeus.com/greatest-hits/>`_ for more).

Another one of note was `Predicting the Present with Bayesian Strucural Time
Series
<http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2013/pred-present-with-bsts.pdf>`_
(or see the `slides
<http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2012/fat-talk.pdf>`_ for an
abbreviated view) in which is described a system for economic nowcasting using
a system where terms correlated to an economic variable e.g. claims for
unemployment are discovered with Google Correlate and then the Google Trends
data for those terms is analysed and ranked in terms of predictability using a
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm - interesting!
