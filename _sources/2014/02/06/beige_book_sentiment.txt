Why?
----

Behavioural finance has provided proof that financial decisions are
significantly driven by emotion and mood [1].

Therefore if we can gauge the mood of policy makers, perhaps we can gauge
policy decision.

Rochester Cahan, VP of Global Equity Quantitative Strategy at Deutsche Bank,
states that the sentiment scores of Thomson Reuters (powered by Lexalytics) are
uncorrelated with traditional quantitative signals [2].

Commercial Products and Funds
-----------------------------

There are a number of commercial products and funds already providing or
exploiting sentiment based signals.

Thompson Reuters recently acquired `Lexalytics <http://www.lexalytics.com/>`_
who provide sentiment indicators in machine readable format. Global sentiment
indicators are also provided by `MarketPsych <https://ww.marketpsych.com>`_, a
spin off company from the now closed MarketPsych Captial fund setup by `Richard
Peterson MD <http://www.richard.peterson.net>`_ who reported a 28% return from
Sept. 2, 2008, through Dec. 31, 2010 while the S&P 500 lost 1.6 percent over
the same period. 

Cayman Atlantic, aka the "Twitter Hedge Fund" is probably the most high profile
use case of sentiment analysis. Founded by Paul Hawtin in 2013 the fund works
closely with the team behind the paper `Twitter Mood Predicts the Stock Market
(pre-print) <http://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.3003&>`_ [3] in order to gauge the
entire Twitter verse in terms of 6 different moods: calm, alert, sure, vital,
kind, happy. They found that predominately only the calm mood was Granger
causative with DJIA.


Sentiment from the Beige Book
-----------------------------

* Beige Book content downloaded pro programmatically since 1970.
* Text cleaned and put into common format.

* Text analysed with Pythons NLTK for sentiment using two dictionaries:
    - Harvard IV-4
    - Loughran and McDonald Financial Sentiment


**Polarity** (P) is defined as:

.. math::

    P = \frac{N_{pos}-N_{neg}}{N_{pos}+N_{neg}}

**Subjectivity** (S) is defined as:

.. math::

    S = \frac{N_{pos}+N_{neg}}{N}


With the Beige Book data set we get the following:

    :width: 600

From the above we can see the differences in the two dictionaries used to
evaluate Sentiment. The Harvard IV-4 dictionary has no concept of financial
lexicon whereas the Loughran and McDonald Financial Sentiment is calibrated
from 10-K file date returns, post-file date returns, return volatility,
allegations of accounting fraud, and company material weakness disclosures, and
as such is more evenly weighted around 0 for Polarity.

Comparing the Loughran and McDonald Financial Sentiment with T-Bill discount
rates gives the following:

By inspection of the above it appears there is some causality/correlation
between sentiment of the Beige Book and the T-bill discount rate. Soon i will
publish statistical analysis of this causality (Granger or otherwise).
